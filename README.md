# HR-Remote-Prep-13-Final-Project
Final Project for Hack Reactor Remote Prep '13

PURPOSE

My partners and I wanted to create a weather recommendation app that allowed you to input a location, see it on a google map and get recommendations based on temperature.

METHOD

We used the Google API and a Weather API in conjunction to allow a user to see both the location and the ambient temperature.  Using CSS styling, we created a floating panel that served both as input and display.  With a series of IF/ELSE statments, we accessed a series of arrays that pertained to hot, mild or cold temperatures.  Depending on the temperature, recommendations would run for one of the three scenarios along with a display of the temperature and a gif that is appropriate to that temperature.  

FUTURE PLANS

This is the first step, and plans include more weather features, pathfinding on the maps, searchable city areas and live webcam images of current weather from nearby weather stations.
